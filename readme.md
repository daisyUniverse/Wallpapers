# My Wallpapers

All wallpapers here are art that I made myself, I hope you like them!  Feel free to use these without restriction, but some of these projects took weeks of effort to make, so if you use them anywhere, please consider linking back here, cheers! 

If you would like to use any of these in a more official project, I'm cool with that, but I'd love to hear about it :>

To download, simply 

`git clone https://github.com/robinuniverse/Wallpapers`

## 3D Art

All work here is done in blender. I will also be releasing .blend files for most of these projects soon!

## Photography

These have been taken over the course of a few years and are pretty much only the photos I'm most proud of
